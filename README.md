# Forecasting-Non-performing-loan-ratios-in-Vietnamese-Commercial-banks

## 🧠 Thesis Overview

This thesis explores the dynamics of **non-performing loans (NPLs)** in Vietnam's banking sector, combining **traditional econometric techniques** and **modern machine learning (ML) methods** to analyze and forecast NPL ratios among **23 joint-stock commercial banks**. The study responds to the sharp rise in NPLs in 2024 and seeks to support banks and policymakers in proactive risk management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze current trends and the state of NPLs in Vietnam from **Q1 2012 to Q3 2024**.
- Identify significant **macroeconomic and microeconomic variables** affecting NPL ratios.
- Apply and compare the performance of traditional, machine learning, and deep learning models for **NPL forecasting**.
- Propose practical recommendations for **mitigating NPL risks** and enhancing credit performance.

---

## ❓ Research Questions

1. **Which macroeconomic factors** have the strongest influence on NPL ratios in both the short and long term?
2. **How accurately** can advanced models (ARIMA, ML models, LSTM) predict future NPL trends?
3. **What measures** should banks take to proactively manage credit risk and ensure sustainable growth?
